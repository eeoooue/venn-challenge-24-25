## Question G: DJ Oâ€™clock

----

After years of fumbling his DJ performances, Oli devised his own system for predicting whether two tracks will have a smooth transition into each other. Before performing, he carefully analyses each of the tracks in his library and assigns them an 'hour' - such as 3 o'clock in the morning. 

Oli finds that using his system, he can achieve a harmonious transition by:
- Mixing between two tracks of the same hour - e.g. 7:00 AM into 7:00 AM
- Mixing between two tracks one hour apart - e.g. 7:00 AM into 6:00 AM or 8:00 AM
- Mixing between two tracks 12 hours apart - e.g. 7:00 AM into 7:00 PM

Oli swears by this system, asserting that transitions that follow these guidelines 'always sound good'. In fact, he has since subjected himself to further restrictions:
- Oli never plays any track more than once within a set
- Oli never transitions into a track more than 2 BPM slower than the one playing
- Oli never transitions into a track more than 5 BPM higher than the one playing

Oli carefully draws a map of his track library by hand in advance of his performances and refers to it throughout each set to ensure all of his transitions are fluid and harmonious. However, on this occasion Oli's hand-drawn guide got soaked in a haphazard water spill.

Oli needs you to save the day. Given his library of tracks: ```DJTrackLibrary.csv```, produce a setlist of exactly **33 tracks** to be played in sequence that abide by Oli's self-imposed restrictions.

Give your answer in the form of the track ids, delimited by commas. Paste your answer into the hex-grid tool under **Question G** and present your pattern for verification.

As an example, ```1,2,3,4,5``` is an incorrect answer given in the correct format.
